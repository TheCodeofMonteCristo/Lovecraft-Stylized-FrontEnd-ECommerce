        <h2>The Lovecraftian Alien Takeover</h2>
        <p>In the year 2060, Earth was swiftly and mercilessly overtaken by an ancient, unknowable force from beyond the starsâ€”an alien species of squid-like beings known as the Great Deep Ones. Under their rule, humanity was enslaved and cities were sold and traded like commodities. Now, these cities are available to the highest bidder, controlled by the Lovecraftian overlords, who use Earth as their playground. The human race is but a shadow of its former self, and all that remains are the cities to be bought, sold, and controlled by those who dare.</p>
