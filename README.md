# Lovecraftian E-commerce Website

This is a mock e-commerce website where Lovecraftian squid aliens have conquered Earth, and human cities are now bought and sold like ordinary products. The project demonstrates the use of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a Lovecraftian theme to build a fun and interactive e-commerce mockup.

## Features:

- **7 pages of mock e-commerce functionality** simulating the sale and purchase of human cities.
- **Responsive navigation bar** that links to all major pages of the website.
- **Interactive elements** built with JavaScript, including hover effects and simple animations.
- **Pale green color palette** with subtle animations to give the site a mysterious Lovecraftian atmosphere.

## Pages:

- **Home Page** (`index.html`) – Introduction to the e-commerce site.
- **City Detail Page** (`city-detail.html`) – Displays detailed information about a specific city.
- **Buy City Page** (`buy-city.html`) – Simulates purchasing a city.
